# Getting Started

LazyMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI tools for mathematical calculations, network analysis, and weather information. Use LazyMCP to enhance your AI assistant with powerful computational capabilities.

## Available Tools

LazyMCP provides 5 tools across 3 categories:

### üå§Ô∏è Weather
- **get_weather** - Current weather conditions
- **get_weather_forecast** - 5-day weather forecast with 3-hour intervals

### üåê Network  
- **get_ip** - Get client IP address
- **get_ip_data** - Get detailed IP geolocation data

### üßÆ Calculator
- **calculate** - Mathematical expression evaluation with support for basic arithmetic, trigonometry, and advanced functions

## Setup Instructions

LazyMCP is available as a public service at `https://lazymcp.ai/mcp`. Follow the instructions below for your AI tool:

### Claude Code (claude.ai/code)

Use the Claude MCP command to add LazyMCP:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http lazymcp https://lazymcp.ai/mcp
```

This command will:
- Add LazyMCP as an MCP server named "lazymcp"
- Configure HTTP transport for the connection
- Connect to the public LazyMCP service

Verify the connection by checking that all 5 tools appear in your Claude Code session.

### Claude Desktop App

1. Open the Claude Desktop application
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Connectors**
3. Click **Add custom connector**
4. Fill out the connector form:
   - **Name**: `LazyMCP`
   - **Remote MCP**: `https://lazymcp.ai/mcp`
5. Click **Add** to save the connector
6. Verify the LazyMCP connector appears as "CUSTOM" in your connectors list
7. Confirm all 5 tools are available in your conversations

:::info
**Location Detection Note**: Claude Desktop makes requests from its own servers, so IP-based location detection may not reflect your actual location. When using weather or geolocation tools, Claude may ask you to specify your city or location for more accurate results.

### OpenCode

Edit your OpenCode configuration file at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and add the MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "lazymcp": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://lazymcp.ai/mcp",
      "enabled": true,
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
}
```

After saving the configuration:
1. Restart OpenCode to load the MCP server
2. Verify all 5 LazyMCP tools are available in your workspace

### Other MCP-Compatible Clients

For any MCP-compatible AI tool, use these connection parameters:

- **Server URL**: `https://lazymcp.ai/mcp`
- **Transport Protocol**: Streamable HTTP
- **Authentication**: None required (public service)

## Verifying Your Setup

Once connected, test LazyMCP with a simple calculation:

**Ask your AI assistant**: "Calculate the square root of 144"

You should see the AI use the `calculate` tool and return: `12`

You can also test other tools:
- "What's the weather like in London?" (uses `get_weather`)
- "What's my IP address?" (uses `get_ip`)

## Using LazyMCP Tools

### Weather Examples
- "What's the current weather?"
- "Get weather forecast for New York"
- "Show me the 5-day forecast for coordinates 51.5074,-0.1278"

### Network Examples  
- "What's my current IP address?"
- "Get geolocation data for IP 8.8.8.8"
- "Where is my internet connection located?"

### Calculator Examples
- "Calculate sin(œÄ/4) + cos(œÄ/4)"
- "What's 2^10?"
- "Solve: sqrt(16) * log(100)"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tools not appearing**: Verify the server URL is exactly `https://lazymcp.ai/mcp` with HTTPS

**Connection failed**: Check your internet connection and ensure your AI client supports MCP

**Weather tools not working**: The public LazyMCP service includes weather functionality - no additional setup needed

**Calculation errors**: Ensure mathematical expressions use supported functions and syntax
